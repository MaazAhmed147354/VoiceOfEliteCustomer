# VoiceOfEliteCustomer
This is a frontend web application designed using HTML, CSS(Bootstrap), Vanilla JavaScript, and many other libraries
The project can be easily run using any IDE that supports the above languages, such as VS Code
This is an e-commerce based site where the customers are the major users, who can excercise their power of interacting with the UI to buy, rate and have a say about the products.
VOEC was a team based project where the UI/UX team provided the Front-end Development team(including me) with the mockups for developing the front-end for the web application.
